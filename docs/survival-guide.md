In hours patients can be referred frailty (544) if medical input
required, or if therapies only then to PT / OT (290). **Out of hours
patient requiring input from these services must be referred to the
medical registrar to ensure comfort and rest as well as being clerked by
the medical team so regular medications are prescribed.**

**<u>If patients are being admitted to DAU then it is the treating
clinicians responsibility to prescribe all the regular medications.
Please all ensure time critical medications are prescribed
promptly.</u>**

**<u>Rheumatology:</u>**

Please send any referrals to burton referrals (to open a pathway) and
the rheumatology secretaries. Provide a summary (copy and pasting V6
notes is fine!) and patient details. This will be reviewed by a QHB
rheumatology consultant. Ensure the ED on call consultant is cc'd into

If out of hours:

**Option 1:** Put a V6 order but then tell the patient to contact
medical photography the next day. Via switchboard Ext 5299

**Option 2:** Take your own photos through outlook (This is IG

Patients suspecting to have TB (based on clinical presentation and/or
CXR findings, please send an email referral to
[**uhdb.tbserviceburton@nhs.net**](mailto:uhdb.tbserviceburton@nhs.net).

During weekdays, you can contact **<u>TB specialist nurse on extension
5050</u>**.

If these patients need hospital admission, must go through acute medical
intake as usual. (chest physicians)

If the reporting radiographers are worried about CXR findings suspicious
of TB, they now will refer to the burton TB service team via email.

**<u>QHB Rabies vaccine pathway:</u>**

Usually, patients present to ED with h/o dog or wild animal bites when
on recent holiday and was advised to get Rabies vaccines when returned
to UK.

We keep **<u>rabies vaccines (RABIPUR)</u>** in our POH cupboard (3-4
vials in the Fridge). We must take one form these and administer the
dose as IM injection.

We then need to complete the risk assessment; the assessing clinician
should then contact RIgS at UKHSA via **0330 128 1020**

RIgS will take details of the patient, their GP surgery address and our
NHS email address (to which they will send the completed risk assessment
from which needs to be attached to the patient records). They will send
2 vials to the patient's GP surgery and advice which dates they need to
have these 2 doses. They will also replace the used Rabipur vaccine from
QHB POH cupboard.

Weekends and Bank Holidays 9am – 7pm (Colindale Duty Doctor Service
hours) Follow the above process, but instead of contacting RIgS, contact
the Colindale Duty Doctor Service via 0208 200 4400.

**<u>Note: UK is not an endemic nation for Rabies and so we do not
usually give "Immunoglobulins" and so do not have in hour
hospital.</u>**
